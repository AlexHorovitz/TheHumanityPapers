# Getting To Infinity and Beyond
As we are riding a technology curve which will very likely, in the near future, displace the world of "work" as we understand it. It is highly likely to deliver to humanity the ability to acquire almost any possession at $0 (zero cost). The purpose of this repository is to explore what what type of arrangements we desire in terms of governments, economic policies, borders and boundaries around the world. 

Humanity is in transition and the scientic method has been a great tool for us in terms of both generating understanding and being able to create testable hypothesises from which we have been able to advance the state of our knowledge. Previous traditional economic models (mercantilism,capitalism,socialism,communism) have been more or less useful in our attempts to allocate scarce resources over history. The traditional economic models will not suffice as we move from scarcity to abundance.

This project is an open source attempt to help engage in the design of a transition plan to move humanity from the current era of continuing scarcity to an era of abundance. Participation is open to all. There will be several sections for which contributions are being sought.

1) Published Research - in the area of published research we are looking to develop a comprehensive library of documents that pertains to the neuro-psychological aspects of human beings and their behavior when presented with gains, losses, and choices. These documents can be used to provide a common base of understanding for participants who wish to engage in the activities of this project.

2) Active Research - this will be open source research in areas where we feel contributions can be made in designing policies that can help ensure smoother transitions from the present state to future states (including intermediary states).

3) Evidenced Based Policy Recomendations - In this section we will publish recomendations to help communities, municipalities, regions, and countries ensure smoother transitions from the present state to future states. In addition, we will collect longitudinal information about published policies and engage in re-evaluation of policies in the face of new streams of data and evidence.

4) Evidenced Based Educational Programs - In this section we will publish age-cognitive-appropriate teaching materials to help educators in their efforts to stay current and provide timely materials as humanity transitions from the present state to future states.

5) Definitions - In this section we will publish definitions for words and terms so there can be widespread agrement about words and terms to facilitate positive discussions about the research with a common understanding informing our discussions.

This is both an ambitious and necessary project. At the time of launch, the repository for knowledge will be this github project, but as participation increased and funding becomes available to support our efforts, we will migrate to other platforms to increase participation to a broader base of people beyond those who can use github.

If you are uncomfortable with command line github as a tracking tool and would like a gui client to use I highly suggest Tower: https://www.git-tower.com/

On behalf of our future selves, thank you for participating!
